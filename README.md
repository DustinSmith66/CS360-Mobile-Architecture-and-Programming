# CS360
I was asked to creat an app that can track someones weight and be able to out perform other apps in the same class.
I accomplished this by analyzing other apps to see what the competetors were doing and what i could do differently to accomplish the goal.
I had to utilize proper features for my app that allowed it to succeed. Using UI design to keep users in mind by allowing for better application design and also using a plan to create the best app. 
I tested the code by utilizing the run code function to see if it was properly running correctly. I also analyzed my code for the best the code that I could create and allow for better user interface.
I think that i was successful in creating the code of my application and that this app could compete with other apps in the same class.
